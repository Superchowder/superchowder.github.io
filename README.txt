Part B: I converted the sample code from the website into code that three js could undertand. I added a cube, a cone and a hexagon. I added a movement effect to the hexagon and made both the cube and the cone change shapes. I used the twist effect that twists the shapes and used a sin function to make them shift between 2 distinct shapes. I also added a wood texture to all the shapes.
