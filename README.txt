Part A: I created 3 seperate objects and lights. I made the lights visible by making them into spheres so its easier to see
in motion. All three objects move and 2 of them are textured. The sphere is textured as stones and the ring is textured with a furturistic styled hexagonal texture. They each have a different shader as well with my favorite being the toon shader that is attached to the ring.

Part B: I modified the shader firstly by changing the picture to Bill Murray. I then changed the shader in order to change the color and invert it the further right the cursor is on the picture. Firstly it changed the contrast of the photo but the further the cursor goes it eventually completely inverts the colors.

Part C: For this one I really messed around with the code. I changed the numbers around and worked with the states to extend the living state to if its next to 2 to 6 living neigbors lives on. I changed the colors of the cells to change based on the older cells. I also slightly changed the resolution size from 300 to 350.
